# Hi There

I grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin and work here as a fulltime software developer.

I also study at the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, finishing my bachelors in Computer Science

I'm a big gamer! I love to cook and had a previous decade-long career in hospitality and restaurant management.
